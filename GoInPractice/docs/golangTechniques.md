 # Golang Techniques Guide

 ## General
 * One can easily work with configuration files in json, yaml and ini.  - technique 3
 * OS package helps to get values from environment - technique 4
 
 ## HTTP and Web Servers
 * We should use channels and goroutines to make graceful shutdowns when dealing with web/http servers
 * HTTP Routing is a big topic and there are many ways to deal with it, some famous libraries/frameworks exist (httprouter, gorrila framework [technique 9]) and some simple default ways are there (technique 6-8)

 ## Concurrency and GoRoutines

 ## Error Handling
 * We should minimize returning nils from programs and return default values whenever possible
 * In go we can mainly define errors on the fly with `errors.New()` but if you want extra information about the error you can define your own custom error
 * A smart idea could be to define a package with error variables of the common errors you exepct and then use it
 * Use panics when something unexpected happens, don't panic unless there's no clear way to handle the situation, use errors instead
 * Use `defer()` and `recover()` from panics that can occur when making further calls within a function
 * Always close files, network connections, sockets etc.

 ## Logging
 * Decide what flags to use when creating a logger
 * You can log to a network resource which will keep on writing on the socket. **We should use event streaming for logging**
 * To handle back pressure when writing to a network resource one might consider converting the protocol from tcp to udp. Pros and Cons are those of TCP vs UDP
 * We should decide which level to write to when using syslog
 * `runtime` and `runtime/debug` packages contain numerous functions for analyzing memory usage, goroutines, threading and other aspects of program's memory usages
 * When logging a stack we can set flags to print out stacks for all running goroutines. Tremendously useful when debugging concurrency problems, but increases output size.
 * We can print stacks from `runtime` & `runtime/debug`. When using `runtime` we must decide ahead how much buffer we need to allocate.
 * For advanced key-value pair logging which is easily understood by computers, [slog](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gookit/slog#section-readme) package exists. [Talk to understand slog](https://opensourcelive.withgoogle.com/events/go-day-2022/watch?talk=talk2)
